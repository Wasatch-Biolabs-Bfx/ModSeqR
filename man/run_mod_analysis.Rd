\arguments{
\item{mod_db}{A `mod_db` object representing the DuckDB database containing methylation data.
The database should include necessary tables for the analysis, such as positions, regions, or windows.}

\item{out_path}{The directory in which the "Mod_Diff_Analysis_Results" directory containing result data will be written out too. 
If the user does not provide a directory, the working directory will be used.}

\item{call_type}{A character string specifying the type of data to analyze. Must be one of:
\code{"positions"}, \code{"regions"}, or \code{"windows"}. This determines the summarization approach to use.}

\item{region_file}{A character string specifying the path to the region annotation file (required if `call_type` is `"regions"`).
This file should be in a supported format (e.g., BED, CSV, TSV).}

\item{window_size}{An integer specifying the window size for summarizing methylation data if `call_type` is `"windows"`.
The default value is 1000.}

\item{step_size}{An integer specifying the step size for sliding windows if `call_type` is `"windows"`.
The default value is 10.}

\item{cases}{A character vector of sample names to be used as cases in the differential analysis.
This argument is required and cannot be NULL.}

\item{controls}{A character vector of sample names to be used as controls in the differential analysis.
This argument is required and cannot be NULL.}

\item{mod_type}{A character string specifying the modification type to analyze. The default is `"mh"`,
which includes both methylation and hydroxymethylation.
Other options are `"c"` for unmodified cytosine, `"m"` for methylation, and `"h"` for hydroxymethylation.}

\item{calc_type}{A character string specifying the type of statistical test to use for the differential analysis.
The default is `"fast_fisher"`, but other calculation methods can be implemented.}

\item{p_val_max}{The p value threshold in which significant differentially modified positions/regions/windows 
will be written out in the final directory.}
}
\value{
The result of the differential analysis, typically in the form of a table or data frame with
  calculated statistics and p-values for each position, region, or window, depending on the `call_type`.
  The result is printed to the console.
}
\description{
This function performs a differential analysis on methylation data based on the specified call type
and applies the appropriate summarization method. It supports analysis of positions, regions, or windows.
The function handles the summarization of methylation data and performs differential modification analysis
based on case-control comparisons.
}
\details{
This function first summarizes the methylation data by the specified call type (positions, regions, or windows).
It then proceeds with a differential modification analysis between the provided case and control samples.
The analysis is tailored based on the selected modification type (`mod_type`) and calculation method (`calc_type`).
