\usage{
export_mod_table(mod_db, table = "positions", out_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{mod_db}{A string. The path to the database containing ch3 files from nanopore data.}

\item{table}{A character vector specifying the table to be exported from the database. Default is "positions".}

\item{out_path}{A string. The path to the directory where the CSV files will be saved. The file will automatically be named "{table name}.csv".}
}
\value{
NULL. The function writes the specified tables to CSV files.
}
\description{
This function exports specified tables from the mod database to CSV files. Can export one or multiple tables as a time. It checks whether each table exists in the database 
before exporting, and provides informative messages for any missing tables. The output CSV files are saved at the specified path.
}
\details{
The function connects to the specified database and iterates through the list of table names provided in the `tables` parameter. 
For each table that exists in the database, it reads the table into R and writes it as a CSV file to the location specified by `out_path`. 
If a table does not exist in the database, a message is printed indicating this.

In case of any error during the execution, a custom error message is displayed. The function ensures that the database connection 
is closed safely using the `finally` block.
}
\note{
The function assumes that the tables specified in `tables` exist in the database and can be accessed via the `DBI` package.
}
