\title{Count unique CpG sites in a CH3 database table}
\usage{
get_mod_cpg_count(ch3_db, table_name = "calls")
}
\arguments{
\item{ch3_db}{Character string giving the path to a CH3 database file,
or an object/handle accepted by \code{.ch3helper_connectDB()}.}

\item{table_name}{Character scalar. Name of the table to query. Defaults to
\code{"calls"}.}
}
\value{
An integer (length-one) giving the number of unique CpG sites,
  returned \emph{invisibly}. If \code{table_name} does not exist, returns
  \code{NULL} invisibly after printing a message. The function also prints a
  formatted summary to the console as a side effect.
}
\description{
Computes the number of unique CpG sites (defined by distinct pairs of
\code{start} and \code{end} positions) in a table of calls within a CH3
database. Accepts either a file path to a database or an existing CH3
database object.
}
\section{Errors}{

If \code{ch3_db} is a character path and the file does not exist, an error is
thrown with \code{stop()} before attempting any connection.
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Using a file path
n <- get_ch3_cpg_count("/path/to/ch3.sqlite", table_name = "calls")
n

# Using a pre-opened handle (package-internal)
dbh <- .ch3helper_connectDB("/path/to/ch3.sqlite")
get_ch3_cpg_count(dbh)              # prints summary, returns value invisibly
}
