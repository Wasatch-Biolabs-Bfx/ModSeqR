\title{Summarize Reads in a Database}
\usage{
summarize_mod_reads(
  mod_db,
  input_calls_table = "calls",
  output_reads_table = "reads",
  regions_table = NULL,
  min_length = 100,
  min_CGs = 5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mod_db}{A character string specifying the path to the DuckDB database.}

\item{min_length}{An integer specifying the the minimum read_length.}

\item{min_CGs}{An integer specifying the minimum number of CG sites required for a read to be included in the summary.}

\item{table_name}{A string specifying what the user would like the name to be called in the database. Default is "reads".}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the database object. The function also outputs a success message and the first few rows of the summarized `reads` table.
}
\description{
This function summarizes reads from a database, filtering and processing 
the data based on a provided key table (if given). It computes statistics 
on the reads such as the number of calls, CpG positions, and fractions of 
methylation (`m`), hemi-methylation (`h`), and total calls. The function 
interacts with the database to generate a `reads` table.
}
\details{
The function connects to the provided DuckDB database, optionally filters reads based on the key table, and then summarizes the read data. It creates a temporary table for the filtered reads (if a key table is provided) and creates a summary table called `reads` with information on the total number of calls, the positions of the first and last CG sites, and counts for different types of calls (`m`, `h`, and `-`).

#Specify the path to the database

 region_bed = system.file("Islands_hg38_test.csv", package = "ModSeqR")
 
 # Summarize Reads
