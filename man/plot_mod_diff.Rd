\title{Plot Differential Methylation Volcano Raster}
\usage{
plot_mod_diff(ch3_db, table)
}
\arguments{
\item{ch3_db}{A `ch3_db` object or a character string representing the file path to a DuckDB database.
The database must contain a table with differential methylation results.}

\item{table}{A character string specifying the name of the table in the database containing the differential methylation data.
The table must contain at least the following columns: `meth_diff` and `p_val`.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the `ch3_db` object after closing the database connection. The function prints the ggplot2 raster plot to the active R graphics device.
}
\description{
Creates a volcano-style raster plot of differential methylation results using database-backed plotting via `dbplot`. 
This function connects to a DuckDB database, retrieves the specified differential methylation table, filters and 
transforms the data, and generates a raster plot with `meth_diff` on the x-axis and `-log10(p-value)` on the y-axis.
}
\details{
The plot uses `dbplot::dbplot_raster()` to efficiently create a raster visualization of large-scale methylation difference data. 
It applies a log10 transformation to the `p_val` column and uses a color gradient to show the density of observations in each bin.
A message is printed to indicate the time taken to generate the plot.
