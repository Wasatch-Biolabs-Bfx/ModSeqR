\title{Create a Compressed Methylation Call Archive (.ch3) from a calls file.}
\usage{
make_mod_archive(file_name, sample_name, out_path, short_ids = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_name}{Path to the input file (tab-delimited) containing methylation calls.}

\item{sample_name}{Name of the sample to embed in the output archive filenames.}

\item{out_path}{Output directory where the `.ch3` files will be written.}

\item{short_ids}{Logical; default is `TRUE`, shortens `read_id` by trimming prefixes to reduce file size.}
}
\value{
(Invisibly) the path template to the output archive files.
Also prints a message with timing information.
}
\description{
Reads a delimited methylation call file and writes it to a compressed archive format.
Useful for standardizing and compressing methylation data across multiple samples.
}
\details{
The input file should contain specific columns such as `read_id`, `chrom`, `ref_position`,
`ref_mod_strand`, `query_kmer`, `call_prob`, `call_code`, `base_qual`, and `flag`.
The function filters out unplaced '-' strand reads with position 0, adds new fields like `start` and `end`,
and writes the result as a compressed Arrow dataset with `zstd` compression.
