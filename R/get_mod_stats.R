#' Compute Statistics for a Ch3 File
#'
#' This function computes various statistics for a given Ch3 file stored in 
#' Parquet format, including total calls, total reads, mean read length, 
#' CpG coverage at different read thresholds, flag distributions, and high-quality 
#' call counts based on probability and base quality thresholds.
#'
#' @param ch3_file Character. Path to the Ch3 file in Parquet format.
#' @param log_file Character (optional). Path to a log file where the output 
#' will be written. If NULL, results are printed to the console.
#' @param min_reads Numeric vector. A set of thresholds for reporting CpG coverage 
#' at different minimum read counts. Default: \code{c(1, 5, 10, 15)}.
#' @param call_prob_threshold Numeric. The minimum modification probability 
#' to consider a high-confidence call. Default: \code{0.9}.
#' @param base_qual_threshold Numeric. The minimum base quality required 
#' to count as a high-quality call. Default: \code{10}.
#' @param silently Logical. If \code{TRUE}, suppresses console output. 
#' Default: \code{FALSE}.
#'
#' @return A list containing:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{num_calls}}{Total number of modification calls in the file.}
#'   \item{\code{num_reads}}{Total number of unique reads in the file.}
#'   \item{\code{cpg_coverage}}{A matrix with CpG coverage counts at different 
#'   \code{min_reads} thresholds.}
#'   \item{\code{flag_counts}}{A data frame with the count and percentage of 
#'   calls per flag value.}
#'   \item{\code{high_conf_calls}}{A data frame with the count and percentage 
#'   of calls with modification probability above \code{call_prob_threshold}.}
#'   \item{\code{high_qual_calls}}{A data frame with the count and percentage 
#'   of calls with base quality above \code{base_qual_threshold}.}
#'   \item{\code{avg_read_length}}{The mean read length.}
#' }
#'
#' @details 
#' The function reads the Ch3 file as a dataset and computes basic statistics 
#' about the calls and reads. It also evaluates CpG coverage based on different 
#' read count thresholds, distributions of flag values, and counts of high-quality 
#' calls based on user-defined probability and quality thresholds.
#'
#' If a \code{log_file} is provided, the results are written to it. Otherwise, 
#' they are printed to the console unless \code{silently = TRUE}.
